ðŸ‘‹ Â Â Hi there, I'm JÃ©rÃ©my, a French front-end developer currently living in the beautiful ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland.

### Work

During the last few years, I've been working on amazing projects for great clients like Uber, Visa, Nova, Zabka and many others. I've been experimenting and working with a lot of different technologies/tools: React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Bash, Psql, Heroku, Firebase, AWS, ...

### Open source

When I'm not busy at work, I create, maintain and contribute to open-source projects:
- [react-native-modalize](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-modalize)
- [react-native-portalize](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-portalize)
- [next-react-svg](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/next-react-svg)
- [next-react-videos](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/next-react-videos)
- [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
- and many others...

### Side-project

I spend a lot of time on my side-project, [hello aurora](https://www.hello-aurora.com/), an app which helps people to observe northern lights more easily. We got rewarded with an [Icelandic Web Award](https://www.svef.is/verdlaun/tilnefningar-2019/) for the best side-project of the year 2019 âœ¨.
